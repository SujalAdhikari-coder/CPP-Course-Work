# CourseWorks_2025

## Overview
Welcome to the **CourseWorks_2025** repository! This repository contains my college coursework for the 2025 semester at **The British College**, where I am pursuing a degree in **Cyber Security** and **Digital Forensics**. The project is organized into four coursework assignments, each focusing on different aspects of C++ programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Coursework Breakdown

### 1. **Coursework-1**:
   - Focuses on the fundamentals of C++ programming, including data types, control structures (if-else, loops), and arrays.
   - Involves implementing simple C++ programs using these basic concepts.

### 2. **Coursework-2**:
   - Covers topics studied from **Week 5 to Week 9**.
   - Requires the development of a programmatic solution using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++.

### 3. **Coursework-3**:
   - Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts learned during **Week 5 and Week 6**.
   - Tasks include solving problems related to inheritance, polymorphism, and other core OOP concepts.

### 4. **Coursework-4**:
   - Delves into advanced OOP topics, such as **Operator Overloading**, **Exception Handling**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.
   - Requires developing programmatic solutions using these advanced OOP concepts in C++.

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following coursework files, each corresponding to a specific assignment:

1. **Coursework-1**: Tasks focused on the basics of C++ programming, including data types, control structures, and arrays.
2. **Coursework-2**: Tasks that involve Object-Oriented Programming, including classes, constructors, and polymorphism.
3. **Coursework-3**: Tasks based on Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
4. **Coursework-4**: Tasks related to advanced OOP concepts like operator overloading, exception handling, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Each folder includes the corresponding code and any relevant documentation.
